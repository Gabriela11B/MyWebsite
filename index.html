            Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network. The series has won several accolades, including seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations, eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations, and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. The series placed fifth on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list, and has been listed as one of the best television series of all time by Time in 2007 and TV Guide in 2013. The series still airs in syndication worldwide. It spawned two feature films, Sex and the City (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010), and a prequel television series commissioned by The CW, The Carrie Diaries (2013-14).
            
            A sequel series titled And Just Like That... premiered on HBO Max on December 9, 2021. The series features Parker, Davis and Nixon reprising their roles, with Cattrall choosing not to return partly due to her long standing and ongoing feud with Parker. <small><a class="seeMore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City#:~:text=14%20External%20links-,Overview,and%20confide%20in%20each%20other.">See more</a></small>
